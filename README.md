# The Impact of Voluntary Care-Seeking on Health Outcomes and Costs: Insights from COVID-19
## Project Overview
This repository shares python codes for the results in the paper intitled The Impact of Voluntary Care-Seeking on Health Outcomes and Costs: Insights from COVID-19. 
we used a compartmental model that has been studied  to assess the impact of voluntary care-seeking on health outcome and costs. In this model the vaccination and testing rate are dependent on the disease status (prevalence and severity) in the population and takes into account the differences risk perception based on immune status. This project aims to analyze the impact of voluntary care-seeking, repersetned by a dynamics rate, on the health outcome and cost related to vaccination, testing and treatment. 

## Content
The present repository contains
###  Codes
- Comprehensive_result_base_case2.ipynb: Contains health coutcome (cumulative incindence, treated, vaccination and tested)  and cost  results based on mandatory only and mandatory and voluntary care-seeking plicy.   
- Contour2.ipynb: Estimated the percentage change in cumulative incidence and total cost relative to baseline values 
   across information coverage scenarios and varying levels of reactivity and prioritization by immune individuals.
- Contour_reactivity_impact.ipynb: Variation in total cases, confirmed cases, and overall costs in response to changes in voluntary vaccination and testing uptake, compared to their respective values under mandatory only levels.
