# The Impact of Voluntary Care-Seeking on Health Outcomes and Costs: Insights from COVID-19
## Project Overview
This repository shares python codes for the results in the paper intitled The Impact of Voluntary Care-Seeking on Health Outcomes and Costs: Insights from COVID-19. 
we used a compartmental model that has been studied  to assess the impact of voluntary care-seeking on health outcome and costs. In this model the vaccination and testing rate are dependent on the disease status (prevalence and severity) in the population and takes into account the differences risk perception based on immune status. This project aims to analyze the impact of voluntary care-seeking, repersetned by a dynamics rate, on the health outcome and cost related to vaccination, testing and treatment. 

## Content
The present repository contains
###  Codes
- Contour_infocoverage_reactivity_prioritization.ipynb: Estimated the percentage change in cumulative incidence and total cost relative to baseline values (cumulative incidence 31.9 million and total cost 1.4 billion)
   across information coverage scenarios and varying levels of reactivity and prioritization by immune individuals.
- Contour_response_vacc_test.ipynb: Variation in total cases, confirmed cases, and overall costs in response to changes in voluntary vaccination and testing uptake, compared to their respective values under mandatory only levels.
  
- Health_cost_output.ipynb: Contains two results- one, the health outcome result (cumulative incindence, treated, vaccination and tested) and Scond, costs (related to treatment, vaccination and testing)  based on the two intervention strategies (only mandatory
  care-seeking and both mandatory and voluntary care seeking)
